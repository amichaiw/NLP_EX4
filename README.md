Category Prediction from News Articles: A NLP Study of Linear Regression, Transformer Fine-Tuning, and Zero-Shot Learning

Utilized the sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups dataset to train models on the following categories: 
'computer graphics', 'baseball', 'science, electronics', and 'politics, guns'. 
Implemented Linear Regression, Fine-Tuning of a Transformer, and Zero-Shot learning models. 
Evaluated and compared the performance of each model in predicting the correct category.
